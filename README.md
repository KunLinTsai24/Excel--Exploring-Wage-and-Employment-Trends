## **Techniques & Tools Used**

1. **Statistical & Lookup Formula**:  
    To calculate average wages and employee counts, formulas like **AVERAGEIFS()**, **SUMIFS()** and **VLOOKUP()** were used to dynamically pull relevant data from the dataset.
2. **Inserting and Formatting Custom Charts**:  
    Various chart types were utilized to best display the data, such as bar charts for wage comparison and pie charts for employee share representation. These charts were customized with specific colors and labels to enhance readability.
3. **Dynamically Highlighting Series**:  
    Conditional formatting was applied to the map section of the dashboard to differentiate between two types of information. When the map shows **Employee per 1,000 Capita**, the regions are highlighted in **orange**, while for **Average Wage**, the regions appear in **green**. This dynamic color change helps the end user quickly distinguish between the metrics being visualized, making the dashboard more intuitive and user-friendly.
4. **Adding Form Controls**:  
    A drop-down list was added to allow users to select different industries, making the dashboard interactive and customizable based on user preference.
5. **Protecting Workbooks and Worksheets**:  
    To ensure data integrity and prevent accidental edits, the workbook and specific sheets were protected. This helps maintain the dashboardâ€™s accuracy for end users.
